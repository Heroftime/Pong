# Pong Game - MonoGame

## Overview
This is a classic Pong game implemented using MonoGame in C#. The game features two paddles and a ball, with a goal to score points by making the opponent miss the ball. The game includes enhancements such as particle effects, power-ups, and dynamic background effects.

## Features
- **Basic Pong Mechanics:** Two-player paddle control with ball physics.
- **Particle Effects:** Visual effects when the ball hits a paddle.
- **Power-ups:** Randomly spawning power-ups that affect paddle size and scoring.
- **Dynamic Background:** Background intensity changes with ball speed.
- **Sound Effects & Music:** Planned to include paddle hit sounds and background music.

## TODO List
- [x] Add a particle effect when the ball hits the paddle.
